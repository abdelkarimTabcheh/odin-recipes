# Foundations - The Odin Project
Basic knowledge and introduction to web dev from The Odin Project.
this path is where it all begins! a hands-on introduction to all of the essential tools you'll need to build real, working websites. you'll learn what web developers do and the foundations you'll need for later courses

In this course from The Odin Project, I learn about the basic web dev tools, like Git fundamentals, text editor and IDE, basic command line, HTML, CSS and Javascript basics, frontend and backend concepts. I practice the basics from HTML and CSS  and the basics from Javascript with some easy projects such as Odin-recipes, landing-page, Rock, paper, and scissors, calculator, etc.
