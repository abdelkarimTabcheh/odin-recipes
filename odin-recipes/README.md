# Odin-recipes 
  It's my first project in The Odin Project.
  
The project is a simple two-tiered HTML website, where the idea is to build a website containing your favorite recipes.
## Things I've learned:
- How to make and clone a repository
- Creating, deleting, copying, and cutting files and directories via the terminal
- Using Visual Studio Code, boilerplates...
- Basics of HTML (Paragraphs, Lists, Images, Links... )
