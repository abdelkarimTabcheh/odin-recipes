    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A strong, aromatic <strong>coffee</strong> mixed with dreamy <strong>caramel brulee</strong> sauce (extra points if you make your own!) and creamy milk, all topped off with a generous dollop of whipped cream and even more caramel sauce because why not? This Starbucks caramel brulee latte copycat recipe tastes exactly like the real thing, but it's much cheaper, quicker and easier to make.
